# WebSocket and Stock Analysis Tools
AnyStock offers a large set of features, that allow you to build your online financial portal and one of the most exciting features is the ability to draw/display on the chart so called drawing tools or, as they are called in our [documentation](https://docs.anychart.com/) and settings, annotations. Also, any financial portal should provide technical indicators to analyze chart and indicate market direction. AnyStock charts are ready to use with real-time data. All you need is to choose data vendor and preferable transfer protocol.
This demo shows how to use AnyStock charts with real-time data and apply analysis tools.

## Demonstrated features
* The real-time data is provided by [CEXIO](https://cex.io/). The data is loaded with Secured WebSocket.
* [Technical indicators](https://docs.anychart.com/Stock_Charts/Technical_Indicators/Overview).
* [Drawing Tools and Annotations](https://docs.anychart.com/Stock_Charts/Drawing_Tools_and_Annotations/Overview). All annotations can be saved to local storage by click on `Save Annotations` button on the toolbar. This allows users to restore all annotations if the page was reloaded or theme or chart settings were changed.
* Changing theme setting on fly.
